📖 Project Overview
The Gacha Strategist App is an interactive web application built with Streamlit. It simplifies the complex "Pity" and "Guarantee" mechanics of Love and Deepspace, 
helping players (Hunters) make data-driven decisions on whether to spend their Diamonds or save for future banners.

## 🚀 Key Features
Intuitive Pity Tracker: Uses an interactive slider to input current pull counts.
"Spook" Logic Translation: Automatically determines Rate-On/Off status by asking user-friendly questions about their last 5-star pull.

### Risk Assessment Zones: Categorizes gacha status into three visual zones:

- 🔵 Blue Zone (Saving): Far from pity, low probability.
- 🟡 Yellow Zone (Soft Pity): Increased probability phase.
- 🔴 Red Zone (Hard Pity): Maximum urgency/Guaranteed phase.

*Strategic Advice: Provides tailored recommendations based on the calculated risk.*
